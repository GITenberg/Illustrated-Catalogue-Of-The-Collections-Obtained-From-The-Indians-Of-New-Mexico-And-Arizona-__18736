<p>
The following catalogue of the collections made during 1879 was prepared
for the First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, but owing to
want of space was not included in that volume. Before the necessity of
this action was made apparent the matter had been stereotyped and it was
impossible to change the figure numbers, etc. This will explain the
seeming irregularity in the numbering of the figures&mdash;the first one
of this paper following the last one of the above-mentioned report. The
second catalogue, that of the collection of 1880, also included in this
volume, has been made to correspond with the first, the figure numbers
following in regular order.</p>

<p class = "padded" align = "right">
<span class = "smallcaps">Washington</span>, <i>January 3, 1881</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>: I have the honor to submit
herewith an illustrated catalogue exhibiting in part the results of the
ethnologic and archaeologic explorations made under your direction in
New Mexico and Arizona during the summer of 1879.</p>

<p>
As you are already familiar with the mode of travel and the labor
necessary in making such investigations and explorations, as well as the
incidents common to such undertakings, and as I do not consider them of
any special interest or value to the catalogue, I have omitted such
details.</p>

<p>
I beg, however, in this connection, to refer to the services of Messrs.
F.&nbsp;H. Cushing, ethnologist of the Smithsonian Institution, and
J.&nbsp;K. Hillers, photographic artist of the Bureau of Ethnology, both
of whom accompanied me on the expedition.</p>

<p>
Mr. Cushing’s duties were performed with intelligence and zeal
throughout. After the field-work of the season was completed he remained
with the Indians for the purpose of studying the habits, customs,
manners, political and religious organizations, and language of the
people; also to explore the ancient caves of that region. His inquiries
will prove of the utmost interest and importance to science. Mr. Hillers
labored with equal zeal and energy. His work is of the greatest value in
illustrating some of the most interesting features of our
investigations. He made a large series of negatives depicting nearly
every feature of the Pueblo villages and their inhabitants. The beauty
and perfection of the photographs themselves fully attest the value and
importance of his work.</p>

<p>
I would extend most cordial thanks to General Sherman for the special
interest he manifested in our work, and for directions given by him to
the officers of the Army serving in the West to assist us in carrying
out the objects of the expedition; and to the officers who so cordially
rendered such aid.</p>

<p>
To General Edward Hatch, commanding the district of New Mexico, we are
indebted for valuable information and material assistance, which were
liberally granted, and to which in great part our success was due. The
party also received valuable aid from Gen. George P. Buell,
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., who was in command at Fort Wingate during our work
at Zuñi, for which I am pleased to extend thanks.

The large number and variety of objects collected by the members of the
expedition, and the many difficulties incident to such undertakings, as
well as the limited time devoted to the preparation of the catalogue,
will account for any imperfections it may contain.</p>

<p>
Hoping, however, that, notwithstanding these, it may serve useful ends
in the continuation of such work,</p>

<p>
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE OF THE COLLECTIONS OBTAINED
FROM THE INDIANS OF NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA IN 1879.</h3>

<p>It is not my intention in the present paper&mdash;which is simply
what it purports to be, a <i>catalogue</i>&mdash;to attempt any
discussion of the habits, customs, or domestic life of the Indian tribes
from whom the articles were obtained; nor to enter upon a general
comparison of the pottery and other objects with articles of a like
character of other, nations or tribes. Occasionally attention may be
called to striking resemblances between certain articles and those of
other countries, where such comparison will aid in illustrating form or
character.</p>

<p>The collection contains two thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight
specimens. Although it consists very largely of vessels and other
articles of pottery, yet it embraces almost every object necessary to
illustrate the domestic life and art of the tribes from whom the largest
number of the specimens were obtained. It includes, in addition to
pottery, implements of war and hunting, articles used in domestic
manufactures, articles of clothing and personal adornment, basketry,
trappings for horses, images, toys, stone implements, musical
instruments, and those used in games and religious ceremonies, woven
fabrics, foods prepared and unprepared, paints for decorating pottery
and other objects, earths of which their pottery is manufactured,
mineral pigments, medicines, vegetable dyestuffs, &amp;c. But the chief
value of the collection is undoubtedly the great variety of vessels and
other articles of pottery which it contains. In this respect it is
perhaps the most complete that has been made from the pueblos. Quite a
number of articles of this group may perhaps be properly classed as
“ancient,” and were obtained more or less uninjured; but by far the
larger portion are of modern manufacture.</p>

<h5 class = "section">ARTICLES OF STONE.</h5>

<p>These consist of pestles and mortars for grinding pigments; circular
mortars, in which certain articles of food are bruised or ground;
<i>metates</i>, or stones used for grinding wheat and corn; axes,
hatchets, celts, mauls, scrapers &amp;c.</p>

<p>The cutting, splitting, pounding, perforating, and scraping
implements are generally derived from schists, basaltic, trachytic, and
porphyritic rocks, and those for grinding and crushing foods are more or
less composed of coarse lava and compact sandstones. Quite a number of
the metate rubbing stones and a large number of the axes are composed of
a very hard, heavy, and curiously mottled rock, a specimen of which was
submitted to Dr. George W. Hawes, Curator of Mineralogy to the National
Museum, for examination, and of which he says:</p>

<p>“This rock, which was so extensively employed by the Pueblo Indians
for the manufacture of various utensils, has proved to be composed
largely of quartz, intermingled with which is a fine, fibrous, radiated
substance, the optical properties of which demonstrate it to be
fibrolite. In addition, the rock is filled with minute crystals of
octahedral form which are composed of magnetite, and scattered through
the rock are minute yellow crystals of rutile. The red coloration which
these specimens possess is due to thin films of hematite. The rock is
therefore fibrolite schist, and from a lithological standpoint it is
very interesting. The fibrolite imparts the toughness to the rock,
which, I should judge, would increase its value for the purposes to
which the Indians applied it.”</p>

<p>The axes, hatchets, mauls, and other implements used for cutting,
splitting, or piercing are generally more or less imperfect, worn,
chipped, or otherwise injured. This condition is to be accounted for by
the fact that they are all of ancient manufacture; an implement of this
kind being rarely, if ever, made by the Indians at the present day. They
are usually of a hard volcanic rock, not employed by the present
inhabitants in the manufacture of implements. They have in most cases
been collected from the ruins of the Mesa and Cliff dwellers, by whose
ancestors they were probably made. I was unable to learn of a single
instance in which one of these had been made by the modern Indians. In
nearly all cases the edges, once sharp and used for cutting, splitting,
or piercing, are much worn and blunt from use in pounding or other
purposes than that for which they were originally intended. On more than
one occasion I have observed a woman using the edge of a handsome stone
axe in pulverizing volcanic rock to mix with clay for making pottery.
Nearly all the edged stone implements are thus injured. Those showing
the greatest perfection were either too small to utilize in this manner
or had but recently been discovered when we obtained them.</p>

<p>The grinders and mortars are frequently found composed of softer
<!--png 512-->
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321"> </a>
rock, either ferruginous sandstone or gritty clays. For a more complete
knowledge of these stone implements we must depend on a comparative
study of large collections from different localities, and such
information as the circumstances attending their discovery may impart,
rather than upon their present condition or the uses for which they are
now employed.</p>

<p>Metates or grain-grinders, pestles and rubbing stones belong to the
milling industry among the Indians. The metates are generally quite
large and heavy, and could not well be transported with the limited
means at the command of Indians. They are therefore well adapted to the
uses of village Indians, who remain permanently in a place and prosecute
agricultural pursuits. They are generally of rectangular shape, and from
10 to 20 inches in length by 6 to 12 in width, and are composed of
various kinds of rock, the harder, coarse-grained kinds being
preferable, though in some instances sandstone is employed; the most
desirable stone is porous lava. These stones are sometimes carried with
families of the Pueblos moving short distances to the valleys of streams
in which they have farms in cultivation. In the permanent villages they
are arranged in small rectangular bins (see Fig. <a href =
"#fig508">508</a>), each about 20 inches wide and deep, the whole series
ranging from 5 to 10 feet in length, according to the number of bins or
divisions. The walls are usually of sandstone. In each compartment one
of these metates or grinding stones is firmly set at a proper angle to
make it convenient to the kneeling female grinder. In this arrangement
of the slabs those of different degrees of texture are so placed as to
produce an increased degree of fineness to the meal or flour as it is
passed from one to the other. But a small number of these slabs were
collected on account of their great weight. Accompanying these metates
are long, slim, flat stones, which are rubbed up and down the slabs,
thus crushing the grain. These hand-stones are worn longitudinally into
various shapes; some have two flat sides, while the third side remains
oval. The same variety exists in regard to the texture of these
rubbing-stones, as in the concave grinders.</p>

<p>The pueblo of Zuñi, from which the most important portion of the
collection was obtained, is situated in New Mexico, near the western
border, about two hundred miles southwest from Santa&nbsp;Fé.</p>

<p>At the time of Coronado’s visit to this country the pueblo was
located at what is now known as “Old Zuñi,” on the summit of a high
<i>mesa</i>. The modern Zuñi is situated upon a knoll in the valley of
the Zuñi River, about two miles from the site of the old town. Certain
writers have regarded Zuñi, or rather “Old Zuñi,” as one of the “Seven
Cities of Cibola.” The evidences found at and around both the old and
present Zuñi are certainly not sufficient to warrant this view, and
further and more careful investigations are necessary.</p>

<p>Zuñi, although lying on the line of travel of military expeditions,
emigrant trains, and trade between the Pacific coast and the Rio Grande,
the foreigners visiting them have seldom remained long in their village;
<!--png 513-->
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322"> </a>
nor has the advancing wave of Caucasian settlement approached
sufficiently near to exert any marked influence on their manners and
customs; at least the form and decoration of their pottery bear no
marked evidence of the influence of the more highly civilized races.</p>

<p>The collection made here by the expedition was more extensive than
that from any other place, and numbers about fifteen hundred objects, of
which by far the larger part is composed of earthenware articles. These
include large and small water vases, canteens of various sizes and
shapes, cooking cups, and pottery baskets used in their dances,
paint-pots, ladles, water jugs, eating bowls, spoons, pepper and salt
boxes, pitchers, bread-bowls, Navajo water jugs, treasure boxes, water
vases, cups, cooking pots, skillets, ancient pottery, animals, and
grotesque images. It belongs mostly to the variety of cream-white
pottery, decorated in black and brown colors; a portion is red ware,
with color decorations in black. There are also several pieces without
ornamentation, and one or two pieces of black ware, but the latter were
most probably obtained from other tribes, and possibly the same is true
in reference to a few pieces of other kinds which present unusual
figures or forms.</p>

<p>A slight glance at the figures depicted on the <i>tinajas</i>, or
water vases, will suffice to show any one who has examined the older
pottery of this region, specimens and fragments of which are found among
the ruins, that a marked change has taken place in their ideas of
beauty. Although the rigid, angular, zigzag, and geometric figures are
yet found in their decorations, they have largely given way to carved
lines, rounded figures, and attempts to represent natural objects.</p>

<p>A few apparently conventional figures are still generally retained,
as around the outside of the necks of the vases and on the outer surface
of the bowls, probably suggested originally by the rigid outlines of
their arid country, and in fact by their buildings. The figure of the
elk or deer is a very marked feature in the ornamentation of their white
ware, and is often found under an arch. Another very common figure is
that of a grotesquely-shaped bird, found also on the necks of water
vases and the outer surface of bowls.</p>


<h5 class = "section">ARTICLES OF CLAY.</h5>

<p>Tinajas, or water vases, are called in the Zuñi tongue
<i>tkāh-wi-nā-kā-tēhl-le</i>. They are usually from 8 to 12 inches in
height, and from 12 to 15 in diameter. A smaller size of the same form
of vessels, which are from 5 to 7 inches in height and from 8 to 10 in
diameter, are called <i>det-tsān-nā</i>. They are of three colors, cream
white, polished red, and black:
<!--png 514-->
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323"> </a>
there are in the collection comparatively few of the second, and but one
of the last variety. The decorations are chiefly in black and brown, but
four or five pieces being in black. The decorations of the cream-white
group present some four general types&mdash;those represented by Figs.
<a href = "#fig359">359</a>, <a href = "#fig363">363</a>, <a href =
"#fig364">364</a>, and <ins class = "correction"
title = "omission in original">&mdash;&mdash;</ins>,
in which the uncolored circular space
forms the distinguishing characteristic; those of which Fig. <a href =
"#fig360">360</a> may be considered a representative, of which type
there are but two specimens in the collection; those represented by Fig.
<a href = "#fig361">361</a>, and those distinguished by the rosette (see
Figs. <a href = "#fig366">366</a>, <a href = "#fig367">367</a>, <a href
= "#fig368">368</a>, and <a href = "#fig370">370</a>).</p>

<p>The following appear to be unique: (<a href = "#item39935">39935</a>)
Fig. <a href = "#fig371">371</a>, (<a href = "#item40785">40785</a>)
Fig. <a href = "#fig375">375</a>, (<a href = "#item41149">41149</a>)
Fig. <a href = "#fig372">372</a>, and (<a href = "#item41167">41167</a>)
Fig. <a href = "#fig374">374</a>.</p>

<p>By a careful study of these decorations we find that they consist
chiefly of the following figures, which are combined in various ways:
triangular figures, usually on the neck; large open circles, frequently
in a diamond figure, as in Fig. <a href = "#fig359">359</a> (<a href =
"#item39871">39871</a>); scrolls; or arches as in Figs. <a href =
"#fig361">361</a>, <a href = "#fig362">362</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In no instance do we find the meander or Greek fret on these, or in
fact any other Zuñi vessels. A marked characteristic of the decorations
on the pottery of this pueblo is the absence of vines and floral figures
so common on those of some of the other pueblos. The nearest approach to
the vine is the double line of scrolls seen in (<a href =
"#item40785">40785</a>) Fig. <a href = "#fig375">375</a>. Although the
checkered figure is common on bowls, the Zuñi artists have appreciated
the fact that it would be out of place on the convex surface of the
water vase. The elks or deer&mdash;for it is difficult to tell which are
intended&mdash;are usually marked with a circular or crescent-shaped
spot, in white, on the rump, and a red diamond placed over the region of
the heart, with a line of the same color extending from it to the mouth,
both margined with white; the head of the animal is always toward the
right.</p>

<p>As will be observed by examining the decorated pieces, the surface is
divided into zones by lines&mdash;sometimes single, sometimes double,
but generally slender&mdash;one near the base, one or two around the
middle, one at the shoulder, and one at the rim; thus forming one zone
embracing the neck, and two or three on the body, exclusive of the
undecorated base. Sometimes there is but one zone on the body as seen in
Figs. <a href = "#fig364">364</a> (<a href = "#item40322">40322</a>) and
<a href = "#fig359">359</a> (<a href = "#item39871">39871</a>);
sometimes two, as shown in Figs. <a href = "#fig367">367</a> (<a href =
"#item40317">40317</a>) and <a href = "#fig370">370</a> (<a href =
"#item41146">41146</a>); but often three, the middle one quite narrow,
as seen in Figs. <a href = "#fig361">361</a> (<a href =
"#item39934">39934</a>) and <a href = "#fig362">362</a> (<a href =
"#item41150">41150</a>). Although not always shown in the figures, the
lines at the rim, shoulder, and bottom are seldom wanting in Zuñi vases.
The zones are often interrupted by broad perpendicular stripes or
inclosed spaces in which circles, scroll figures, or rosettes are
inserted.</p>

<p>Measurements of these vessels show considerable uniformity of
proportion, the widely exceptional specimens being also exceptional in
decorations. As indicating size and proportion I give here the
measurements of some typical as well as some abnormal specimens.</p>

unusually broad in proportion to the height. Nos. 152 and 153 vary to

<p>Most of the water jugs of both the Shinumos and Zuñians are in the
form of canteens, usually more or less spherical, and varying in
capacity from a pint to four gallons. On each side there is a small
handle in the form of a loop or knob, through or around which is placed
a small shawl or strip of cloth, or a cord long enough to pass over the
forehead so as to suspend the vessel against the back just below the
shoulders. The other jugs are of various fanciful shapes, which will be
noted in the catalogue. A large portion are of plain brown ware, a few
plain white, and others white with colored decorations. Various names
are used apparently to designate the different kinds rather than the
uses for which they are intended.</p>

<p>The decorations, when present, are always on the upper side, which
<!--png 516-->
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325"> </a>
is more convex than the lower, or side on which it is intended the
vessel shall lie when not in use. In the ornamented white ware the lower
portion is usually red or brown.</p>

<p>As all these clay fabrics are the work of North American Indians, it
is scarcely necessary for me to say that they are unglazed, a
characteristic, so far as I am aware, of all aboriginal pottery.</p>

<p>Some of the specimens, especially of the black ware, show a smooth
finish, and may perhaps, without violence to the term, be classed as
lustrous. This is not the effect of a varnish or partial glazing, but is
a polish, produced generally, if not always, by rubbing with a polishing
stone.</p>

<p>Although, as a rule, the paste of which the ware is made is
comparatively free from foreign matter, yet many pieces, especially of
the decorated ware, when broken, show little whitish or ash-colored
specks. These, when found in aboriginal pottery east of the Mississippi,
have, I believe, been without question considered as fragments or
particles of shell broken up and mixed with the paste. This may be
correct in reference to the pottery found east of and in the Mississippi
Valley, but this whitish and grayish matter in the pottery of the
Indians of New Mexico and Arizona is in most cases pulverized pottery,
which is crushed and mixed with the paste. Black lava is sometimes
crushed and used in the same manner.</p>

<p>The principal material used is a clay, apparently in its natural
state, varying in color according to locality. Although comparatively
free from pebbles or lumps of foreign matter, we detect in some of the
coarser specimens small particles of mica and grains of other materials,
and in one broken specimen the elytron of a small coleopterous insect.
But as a general rule, the paste appears to have been free from foreign
matter.</p>

<p>A slight glance at this large collection is sufficient to show that
the potters worked by no specific rule, and that they did not use
patterns. While it is apparent that only a few general forms were
adopted, and that, with few exceptions, the entire collection may be
grouped by these, yet no two specimens are exactly alike; they differ in
size, or vary more or less in form. The same thing is also true in
reference to the ornamentation: while there is a striking similarity in
general characteristics, there is an endless variety in details. No two
similar pieces can be found bearing precisely the same ornamental
pattern.</p>

<p>Much the larger portion of the collection consists of vessels of
various kinds, such as bowls, cooking utensils, canteens, bottles, jars,
pitchers, cups, ladles, jugs, water vases, ornamental vessels,
paint-pots, &amp;c. These vary in size from the large vase, capable of
holding ten gallons, to the little cup and canteen, which will contain
less than half a pint. The other and much smaller portion includes all
those articles which cannot be classed as vessels, such as images, toys,
toilet articles, representations of animals, &amp;c. The collection can
perhaps be most satisfactorily
<!--png 517-->
<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326"> </a>
classified by reference to the coloring, ornamentation, and quality,
thus:</p>

<p>1. <i>The red or uncolored pottery</i>, which is without
ornamentation of any kind. Some of this is coarse and rough, and in this
case always more than ordinarily thick; but the larger portion has the
surface smooth and often polished. The color varies from the natural
dull leaden hue of the clay, to a bright brick red, the latter largely
predominating.</p>

<p>2. <i>The brown ware</i>, or that which shows an admixture of mica.
This, although uniformly without color decorations, is occasionally
marked with impressed figures and lines. Although inferior in quality,
being coarse and fragile, it presents more symmetrical though less
varied forms than are usually found in the preceding group. The
influence of contact with the European races is here very apparent, as,
for example, in the true pitcher and other common utensils and an
apparent attempt at glazing.</p>

<p>3. <i>The black ware</i> which is without ornamentation. This variety
in quality and character is precisely like the polished red of the first
group; but is slightly in advance of that in regard to finish, and
perhaps, as heretofore remarked, may be classed as lustrous, while the
red may be classed as semi-lustrous. The paste of which this black ware
is formed appears to have been better prepared than that of the
preceding varieties, and is the hardest and firmest in the
collection.</p>

<p>4. <i>The cream-white pottery decorated in colors</i>. This extensive
group, which includes fully two-thirds of the entire collection,
embraces almost every known form of earthenware manufactured by the
tribes from whom it was obtained. The paste of which it is formed is
similar in character to that of the black ware. When broken the fracture
shows very distinctly the effect of burning, the interior being of the
natural leaden color, shading off to a dull grayish white as it
approaches the outer surface. The opaque or creamy-white color of the
surface is produced by a coating of opaque whitewash. Upon this white
surface the figures are afterwards drawn.</p>

<p>The only colors used in decorating pottery are black, red, and some
shade of brown. But of this we will speak more fully when we come to
describe the peculiar methods practiced by the different tribes in
making and adorning pottery.</p>

<p>Although there is a strong general similarity in this colored
ornamentation, the great variety of details renders it difficult to
classify the figures so as to convey a correct idea of them to the
reader. We shall therefore have to refer him to the numerous cuts and
the colored plates which have been introduced for the purpose of
illustrating the catalogue.</p>

<p>The following general statement is about all that can be said in
reference to them before descending to specific details.</p>

<p>So far as the coloring is concerned they are of two kinds, those
having
<!--png 518-->
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327"> </a>
the figures wholly black, and those which are partly black and partly
brown or red. The differences in the decorated pottery appear to be
always accompanied by certain other variations sufficient to warrant
speaking of them as different varieties or groups. The former (those
having the figures wholly black), which are made of the ordinary plastic
blue clay, have only the upper half or two-thirds of the body of the
vessel overlaid with the white coating for receiving the decorations,
the lower part being uncoated, and of the natural pale red or salmon
color produced by burning, but usually well polished. As additional
distinguishing features of this group we notice that the shape is more
generally globular, the workmanship rather superior, and the pottery
somewhat harder and less friable than that of the other group; the
angular and geometrical figures formed by straight lines are more common
in this group; here we also find the meander or Greek fret correctly
drawn, the vine, and several other designs rarely or never found in the
other group. The figures of animals, which are common to both varieties,
are in the former more usually distributed in zones or groups, while in
the latter they are generally placed singly in inclosed spaces. The
latter variety, in which we see the curve freely used, shows an evident
advance over the ornamentation of the older pottery of this region; and
while the figures must be classed as rude, and the outlines are less
sharp, and not so well defined as in the older specimens, yet they
indicate clearly a mental advance in the greater variety of
conception.</p>

<p>The figures of this entire class, as regards forms, may be grouped
under three general headings: first, the geometrical, which is the most
common; second, the figures of animals; and, third, rude attempts at
floral decorations, which forms are rather rare. Strange to say, in but
few instances can any attempt at representing the human form or any part
of it be discovered in these color decorations.</p>

<p>The geometric figures present an endless variety; but we notice, as
is shown by the cuts and plates, that triangles with an elongate
acuminate apex and the zigzag are very common in the black-brown
decorations. The checkered figure also is not uncommon. The animals most
frequently represented are the elk or deer and birds. The floral
decorations are chiefly vines well drawn, and rude attempts at
representing trees, and the flowers of various species of
<i>Helianthus</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Red ware with color decorations</i>. This ware is represented
by but few vessels, which are in every respect similar to the best
variety of the red pottery heretofore mentioned, except that it is
marked with figures in black, many of which are decorated only on the
upper portions around the neck or rim.</p>

<p>6. <i>The ancient pottery</i>, of which Figs. <a href =
"#fig680">680</a> (<a href = "#item40816">40816</a>) and <a href =

examples.</p>

<p>The Pueblo tribes of New Mexico and Arizona, with rare exceptions,
manufacture earthenware vessels for domestic use. The Pueblo of Taos may
be mentioned as one of these exceptions; although the manner of
<!--png 519-->
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328"> </a>
living, the general habits, and characteristics of the tribe are similar
to those of the other Pueblo Indians, and although they make use of
pottery for domestic purposes, they do not manufacture it. Some pieces,
such as water jars and vessels used for cooking, are made in the
village, but this occurs only in such families as have intermarried with
other tribes where the manufacture of the native ware is
carried&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>The Pueblos among whom the manufacture of pottery or earthenware
utensils may be classed as a conspicuous feature of their peculiar
civilization at the present time, are situated geographically as
follows: San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Cochiti, Santo Domingo,
San Felipe, Sandia, and Isleta, located on the Rio Grande; Pojake,
Tesuke, Nambe, Jamez, Zia or Silla, Santa Ana, Laguna, and Acoma,
situated on the tributaries of the Rio Grande; Zuñi, and some small
pueblos of the same tribe all within the borders of New Mexico. Zuñi
however is located on the Rio Zuñi, which flows into the Little Colorado
River.</p>

<p>The Moki pueblos, numbering seven in all, are embraced in what is
called the Province of Tusyan, and are located within the Territory of
Arizona, near its northeastern corner.</p>

<p>The Zuñians and Shinumos, although situated farther from civilized
people and less influenced by their usages than any of the other Indians
mentioned, surpass all the other tribes in the manufacture of all kinds
of earthenware. The collections made from these tribes, as will be seen
by reference to the catalogue, exceed, both in number and variety, those
from all the others combined. The collection as enumerated in the
catalogue includes specimens from all the pueblos referred&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>Although the uses of these articles are to a great extent the same
among all the Pueblo tribes, and the shapes and forms are apparently
similar, yet to the experienced eye there is no difficulty in detecting
the peculiarities which distinguish one from the other, or at least in
assigning them to the tribes with which they originated.</p>

<p>It will be observed by reference both to the colored and wood-cut
illustrations that there are special distinctions between the
ornamentation of the pottery of the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley and
of those situated on the tributaries of the Rio Colorado. In the
decorations of the former the birds and vine are conspicuous and
constantly recurring features, while in the Zuñi and Shinumo pottery the
elk, domestic animals, and birds peculiar to these arid regions are the
figures most frequently used. The difference is easily accounted for
when we are informed of the fact that the former tribes reside in the
valley of the Rio Grande, which is well adapted to the culture of the
grape as well as other crops. The ever-present vine and the numerous
birds which flock to this fertile valley will naturally suggest figures
for decoration. On the other hand, the Zuñians and Shinumos reside in
regions almost destitute of water, and hence without any attractive
vegetation; therefore their designs are drawn chiefly from the sharp
outlines of their dwellings, their domestic animals, birds, and the elk
and antelope that graze in the little
<!--png 520-->
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329"> </a>
grassy oases. None of these are actually drawn from nature, but from
imagination and memory, as they never have an object before them in
molding or painting.</p>

<p>In none of the cases referred to do we observe any attempts to
imitate the exact forms or ceramic designs of the so-called ancient
pottery, fragments and sometimes entire vessels of which are found
throughout this southwestern region. This seems strange from the fact
that in the use of stone implements we find but few which are the result
of their own handiwork. The old ruins are searched, and from them, and
the debris about them, stone pestles, mortars, hammers, hatchets,
rubbing stones, scrapers, picks, spear and arrow heads, and polishing
stones are collected by the inhabitants of nearly all the pueblos, and
are kept and used by them.</p>

<p>The clay mostly used by the Zuñians in the manufacture of pottery is
a dark, bluish, carbonaceous, clayey shale found in layers usually near
the tops of the mesas. Several of these elevated mesas are situated near
Zuñi, from which the natives obtain this material. This carbonaceous
clay is first mixed with water and then kneaded as a baker kneads dough
until it reaches the proper consistency; with this, crushed volcanic
lava is sometimes mixed; but the Zuñians more frequently pulverize
fragments of broken pottery, which have been preserved for this purpose.
This seems to prevent explosion, cracking, or fracture by rendering the
paste sufficiently porous to allow the heat to pass through without
injurious effect. When the clayey dough is ready to be used a sufficient
quantity is rolled into a ball. The dough, if worked by a careful
artist, is first tested as to its fitness for molding by putting a piece
of the paste to the tongue, the sensitiveness of which is such as to
detect any gritty substance or particles, when the fingers fail to do
so. The ball is hollowed out with the fingers into the shape of a bowl
(this form constituting the foundation for all varieties of earthenware)
and assumes the desired form by the addition of strips of the clay; all
traces of the addition of each strip are removed before another is
added, by the use of a small trowel fashioned from a piece of gourd or
fragment of pottery, the only tool employed in the manufacture of
pottery.</p>

<p>The bottoms of old water jars and bowls form stands for the articles
while being worked by the potter. The bowls are filled with sand when
objects of a globular form are to be made. Although I have often watched
the process, yet in no instance have I ever observed the use of a
potter’s wheel, measuring instrument, or model of any kind. The makers,
who are always females, depend entirely on memory and skill derived from
practice to accomplish their work. The vessels when completely formed
are laid in some convenient place to sun-dry. A paint or solution is
then made, either of a fine white calcareous earth, consisting mainly of
carbonate of lime, or of a milk-white indurated clay, almost wholly
insoluble in acids, and apparently derived from decomposed feldspar with
a small proportion of mica. This solution is applied to
<!--png 521-->
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330"> </a>
the surface of the vessel and allowed to dry; it is then ready for the
decorations.</p>

<p>The pigments from which the paints are derived for decorative
purposes are also found in the vicinity of the mesas, and are employed
by the Indians in the production of two colors, each of which varies
slightly according to the intensity of heat in the process of baking, or
the manner in which it is applied. One varies from a black to a
blackish-brown, the other from a light brick red to a dark dull red
color. The material which produces these colors is generally found in a
hard, stony condition, and is ground in a small stone mortar, just as we
reduce India ink for use. When the pigment is properly reduced, and
mixed with water so as to form a thin solution, it is applied with
brushes made of the leaves of the yucca. These brushes are made of flat
pieces of the leaf, which are stripped off and bruised at one end, and
are of different sizes adapted to the coarse or fine lines the artist
may wish to draw. In this manner all the decorations on the pottery are
produced.</p>

<p>The substance used in producing the black ware is a clayey brown
hematite, or ferruginous indurated clay, quite hard. The material used
to produce the red or brown colors is a yellowish impure clay, colored
from oxide of iron; indeed it is mainly clay, but contains some sand and
a very small amount of carbonate of lime. These are the principal
ingredients and methods involved in the manufacture of Zuñi pottery.</p>

<p>The method practiced by the Zuñians in baking pottery differs
somewhat from that employed by the tribes who make quantities of black
and red ware. It seems to be a necessity on the part of the Zuñians to
observe the greatest care in this operation. Their pottery is nearly all
decorated and must be baked free from contact with the peculiar fuel
used for that purpose. During the baking process it sometimes happens
that a piece of the fuel, which is composed of dried manure carefully
built up oven-shaped around the vessels to be baked, falls against the
vessel. In every such instance a carbonized or smoky spot is left on the
jar or bowl, which is regarded by the Indians as a blemish. The kiln is
carefully watched until the fuel is thoroughly burnt to a white ash,
when the vessels can be removed without danger of such blemishes.</p>

<p>The mode of manufacturing pottery adopted at the pueblos of the Rio
Grande Valley is quite similar to that described as practiced by the
Zuñi, Shinumo, Acoma, and Laguna Indians, but there is considerable
difference in the method of decorating and polishing. Polishing is
practiced chiefly by the Indians of the eastern pueblos, and but little
by those of the more western region.</p>

<p>The pueblos of Santa Clara, Cochiti, San Juan, Tesuke, &amp;c.,
manufacture large quantities of pottery for sale in addition to that
made for their own use. It is in these eastern pueblos that the black
polished ware is chiefly found, and it is in the production of this
class of ware that the chief difference in the ceramic art between the
two sections exists. The clays used in the manufacture of this ware are
of the same
<!--png 522-->
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331"> </a>
character as those of which the other is made; the paste is prepared in
the same way, so that when the vessels are formed and ready for the kiln
they are of the color of the original clay. In other words, the change
to the black color is not produced in making the paste or in moulding or
forming the vessel, but during the process of baking. The manner of
forming the vessel is the same as with the western tribes; and when,
formed it is dried in the sun in the same way; after this a solution of
very fine ochre-colored clay is applied to the outside and inside near
the top, or to such parts of the surface as are to be polished. While
this solution thus applied is still moist, the process of polishing
begins by rubbing the parts thus washed with smooth, fine-grained stones
until quite dry and glossy. The parts thus rubbed still retain the
original red color of the clay. The vessels are again placed in the sun
and allowed to become thoroughly dry, when they are ready for baking. It
is in this part of the process that the great differences in color are
produced. The vessels are placed together in a heap on a level spot of
ground and carefully covered over with coarsely broken dried manure
obtained from the corrals. The kiln thus formed is then ignited at
several points.</p>

<p>It is proper to add here that the clays used by the Santa Clara
Indians are of a brick-red color, containing an admixture of very fine
sand, which, no doubt, prevents cracking in burning, and hence dispenses
with the necessity of using lava or pottery fragments, as is the custom
of the Indians of the western pueblos. The burning is carried on until a
sufficient degree of heat is obtained properly to bake the vessels,
which still retain their original red brick color. At this juncture such
of the vessels as it is desired have remain in that condition are
removed from the fire and allowed to cool, when they are ready for use.
Those which the artists intend to color black are allowed to remain and
another application of fuel, finely pulverized, is made, completely
covering and smothering the fire. This produces a dense, dark smoke, a
portion of which is absorbed by the baking vessels and gives them the
desired black color. It is in this manner that the black ware of these
eastern pueblos is produced.</p>

<p>It is said that among the Cochiti, Santa Clara, and some other
Pueblos a vegetable matter is employed to produce some of their
decorative designs; this, however, I was unable to verify, though some
of the Indians assured me of the fact, and furnished me a bunch of the
plant, which Dr. Vasey, of the Agricultural Department, found to be
<i>Cleome integrifolia</i>, a plant common throughout the Western
Territories. A few specimens of the ware, some burnt and some unburnt,
said to be decorated with the oil or juice of this plant were
secured.</p>

<p>As heretofore remarked, notwithstanding the variety in ornamentation,
there are really but few different figures, and these are mostly quite
simple. Any one interested in the study of Indian art can find in the
<!--png 523-->
<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<a name = "page332"> </a>
figures and plates of this catalogue all the original conceptions of the
artists of the Pueblo Indians as depicted by them.</p>

<p>While it is of value in the study of ethnology, and as affording a
means of comparison in the study of archaeology, there is nothing in the
composition or ornamentation, or in the form of the vessels, that
ceramic artists of the civilized races would desire to copy.</p>

<p>As a means of reference in the study of ancient American pottery, I
consider the collection invaluable, as it can scarcely be possible that
the forms and decorations contain nothing that has been handed down from
a former age. Although the figures used have no symbolic characters
connected with them in the mind of the modern artist, yet it is more
than probable that at least some of them did have such a meaning to the
ancient artists. For example, the little tadpole-shaped figure on the
clay baskets used in their dances and sacred ceremonies by the Zuñians
is understood by them to represent a little water articulate, which, as
heretofore stated, is probably the larva of some insect or crustacean,
very common in the pools and sluggish streams of the country inhabited
by these Indians. Now, it is possible that this figure has been used
with the same meaning from time immemorial, but I find, as pointed out
to me by Prof. Cyrus Thomas, that almost exactly the same figure is on a
vessel pictured on Plate VII of the manuscript Troano, where a religious
ceremony of some kind is evidently represented. The same figure is also
found in Landa’s character for the Maya day <i>Cib</i>, a word
signifying copal, a gum or resin formerly used in religious ceremonies
as incense. I find also on Plate XXXV of the same manuscript the figures
of bowls or pots with legs similar to those of the Zuñi. I do not point
out these resemblances as proof of any relation between the two races,
but as mere illustrations of what possibly may be learned by a careful
study of the forms and decorations of this pottery. It may also be well
to add here another fact to which Professor Thomas calls my attention,
viz., the similarity between the manner of wearing the hair by the
Shinumo women, <i>i.e.</i>, in knots at the side, as represented by the
female images, and that of the ancient Maya women, as shown in numerous
figures on the manuscript Troano. Any one familiar with General
Cesnola’s collection from Cyprus cannot fail to be reminded of it when
he examines this collection of Indian pottery; especially the colors
used and the general character of the specimens; but an inspection of
the two collections is necessary in order to have this general
resemblance brought to mind, as it does not appear so distinctly on a
comparison of the published figures only. The figures on Plate XLIV of
his “Cyprus” bear quite a striking resemblance to those on some
specimens of Cochiti ware. The quadruple cup, Fig. 25, page 406, is
almost exactly like the Zuñi quadruple cups, and was probably used for
the same purpose. The same type of multiple cups is also shown in Plate
IX of the same work. The two tea-pot-like vessels represented on Plate
VIII, as well as the two bird-shaped pieces on the same
<!--png 524-->
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333"> </a>
plate, are much, like the similar vessels of Cochiti pottery, several of
which are figured in this catalogue.</p>

<p>The resemblance of this Indian ware, in the form of the vessels, to
that found in the ancient mounds of this country is so marked that it is
scarcely necessary to remind the reader of the fact, but it may be well
to call attention to the much, larger proportion of water vessels among
the Indian pottery than is seen in collections from the mounds. This,
however, may perhaps be accounted for by the scarcity of water in the
western region.</p>

<p>The custom of the Zuñi artists of making a diamond or triangle over
the region of the heart of the elk and deer figures with a line running
to the mouth, although somewhat singular, is quite consistent with the
Indian practice of symbolic writing. I was informed by the Zuñi Indians
that it was intended to denote that “the mouth speaks from the heart.” A
similar mark occurs in the decoration of the vase figured in Cesnola’s
“Cyprus,” page 268.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous and somewhat closely related tribes may use widely
different figures in the decoration of their ware, and hence it is
unsafe, in studying ancient specimens, to draw hasty conclusions from
slight differences in this respect; and I think I may also safely add
that a comparatively short period of time, a century or so at most, may
suffice to bring about a great change in the same tribe in the form and
manner of decorating their pottery. It also shows us that the ware of a
given tribe, which does not bear the impress of civilized influence,
can, by a careful study, be distinguished in nearly all cases from that
of any other tribe. I feel so confident of the truth of this statement,
that I would not hesitate to undertake to pick out all pieces of Zuñi
ornamented ware from a collection of thousands of specimens of modern
Pueblo Indian pottery if indiscriminately mixed together.</p>

<p>The Shinumo pottery in general appearance and form bears a strong
resemblance to that of Zuñi; in fact it is almost impossible to separate
the ornamented bowls and water vases of the two if mingled together.
There are certain figures found in the one which never occur in the
other, but there are a number of designs, especially of those most
generally seen, that are quite common to the pottery of both tribes.</p>

<p>The different varieties of ware, the red or brown without
decorations, the white with decorations, and the black are in general
use with the tribe, and specimens of each are contained in the
collection. But few specimens of the purely micaceous ware are found,
either in Zuñi or Wolpi.</p>

<p>The preponderance of the large round water jugs in the Shinumo
collection over that of Zuñi is noticeable. This form of vessel seems to
be more in use by tribes whose villages are quite remote from water or
which are situated on high mesas difficult of access. The kinds of
vessels, however, which are common with the Zuñians are also common with
the Shinumos, and those intended for the same use are generally of the
same
<!--png 525-->
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334"> </a>
shape or similar in form. But, as with the decorations, there are also
vessels so markedly distinct and variant from those we find at Zuñi as
to show very readily at least tribal distinctions between the ceramic
artists and manufacturers.</p>

<p>The proximity of Laguna to Acoma led us to anticipate what we
afterward found, viz., a great similarity in the forms of their vessels,
and also in their manner of ornamentation. The principal differences
consist in the more profuse use of the forms of birds and flowers, the
first evidently representing prairie grouse and the last some form of
sunflower. There is an absence of the geometrical forms, of lines and
angles commonly observed on the works of more distant pueblos.</p>

<p>Quite a number of animal representations, made hollow for use as
drinking vessels, were obtained, displaying grotesquely imitative forms
of deer, elk, sheep, big-horn, antelope, and other animals with which
they are familiar. All of these objects have more color laid on them
than is to be found on the pottery of their neighbors of Acoma, the
birds and animals being painted in a light rufous fawn color not in use
elsewhere, and the only instance of the employment of green is on a
tinaja of this pueblo used in coloring some foliage.</p>


<h5 class = "section">VEGETAL SUBSTANCES.</h5>

<p>This class of ware comprises a very diversified group of objects;
indeed, so great is the variety that I will not attempt a general
description of them. Specific reference will be made to the objects as
they occur in their places in the catalogue.</p>

<p>The objects of basketry or wicker-work are quite varied in form,
construction, and decoration. Those made by the Zuñi Indians are so rude
and coarse as not to entitle them to any merit. The larger baskets made
by this tribe are used for carrying corn, melons, peppers, &amp;c. The
smaller are used for holding beans, shelled corn, and other coarse small
materials.</p>

<p>The basketry of the Shinumos is of a finer and more finished quality.
Among these are many jug or canteen shaped baskets, from which, no
doubt, many of the forms of their pottery water vessels have been
copied. These are sometimes globular, with large round bodies and small
necks. They are generally very closely woven and are then coated over
with a resin or gum which renders them capable of holding water. Like
some of their water jugs, in pottery, they have small horsehair ears or
loops attached to the sides through which strings are passed for
carrying them either over the head or shoulder. This class of water jug
basketry all show evidences of age, and it is possible that they were
manufactured by the Apaches or other tribes skilled in the art. The
<!--png 526-->
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335"> </a>
flat kinds are designed to hold fine grain and meal, and are also
frequently used for winnowing. This is done by placing a small quantity
of grain in the basket, and by a skillful motion throwing the grain up
into the wind and again catching it as it comes down. This motion is
kept up until the wind has separated the chaff from, the grain. Many of
the flat baskets are decorated in colors, as will be seen by the
accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that most of the finer ware of this class is
manufactured by the Apache Indians, who are celebrated for this work,
and finds its way among the Pueblos through the medium of barter.</p>

<p>The basketry of the Zuñians is usually made of small round willows
and the stem of the yucca, the leaves of which attain a long slender
growth in that region. It is quite certain that the basketry used for
holding water is not manufactured by the Zuñians, and probably not by
the Shinumos, though many are found with them.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the basketry manufactured by the Shinumo
Indians is of a more finished class and of a greater variety than that
made and used by any of the other Pueblos, as will be seen by reference
to the accompanying illustrations. Among the examples of this ware,
obtained at Wolpi, is a large number of the flat or saucer-shaped kind;
these vary both in size and character of construction as well as
decoration. The manner of making one form of this class is quite
interesting as well as curious. A rope-like withe of the fiber of the
yucca, made quite fine, is wrapped with flat strips of the same plant.
In forming the basket with this rope the workman commences at the
center, or bottom, and coils the rope round, attaching it by a method of
weaving, until, by successive layers of the rope, it attains the desired
dimensions. These are quite highly and prettily ornamented in black,
white, and yellow, and are compact and strong. Another variety of
baskets of similar shape and size, and also fancifully ornamented, was
obtained from the same Indians. These are made from small round willows.
They exhibit less skill in construction, but are handsomely ornamented.
Another kind was also obtained from the Shinumos, which, however, are
attributed to the Apaches and probably found their way into the Moki
villages through trade. These are large bowl-shaped baskets, almost
watertight, but generally used as flour and meal baskets. They are also
ornamented black and yellow, produced by weaving the material of
different colors together while making the basket.</p>

<p>There are many other forms and varieties, which will be referred to
at the proper time, as they occur in the catalogue.</p>

<p>The Pueblos employ a variety of plants and herbs for medicinal and
dyeing purposes, some of which were collected. Their botanical names
were not determined, but they are indigenous to the regions inhabited by
the Indians using them.</p>

<p>Ornaments and musical instruments employed in dances and religious
ceremonies do not differ much among the Pueblo Indians; the principal
<!--png 527-->
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336"> </a>
ones being the drum, rattle, notched sticks, a kind of fife, and a
turtle-shell rattle. The latter instrument is the shell of a turtle,
around the edges of which the toes of goats and calves are attached;
this produces a very peculiar rattling sound. The shell is usually
attached to the leg near the knee.</p>

140. (<a name = "item39871">39871</a>). Form and decorations shown in
Fig. <a href = "#fig359">359</a>. The slender shading lines only are
brown, the rest of the figuring black; the base in this as in most Zuñi
pottery is reddish or slate colored. This may be considered as the type
of one variety of decorations, readily distinguished by the unadorned
circular spaces, the large scrolls, and the absence of animal forms. The
larger forms of these vases are called by the Zuñians
<i>kāh´-wi-nā-kä-tēhl-le</i>; the smaller forms, <i>det-tsan-na</i>.</p>

141. (<a name = "item39916">39916</a>). The ornamentation is well shown
in Fig. <a href = "#fig360">360</a>. The combinations on this piece are
rare on Zuñi pottery, and the chief figure on the body is more
symmetrical than is usual in this group of ware. This may also be
considered as representing a second type of decorations of which there
is but one other example in the collection.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
142. (39920). This belongs to the variety represented by Fig. <a href =
"#fig360">360</a>, and varies chiefly in having the neck decorated with
leaf-like figures, and in having the scrolls replaced by triangles with
inner serratures.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
143. (<a name = "item39934">39934</a>). The largest size; Fig. <a href =
"#fig361">361</a>. The decorations of this piece belong to a third
variety, distinguished chiefly by the presence of the elk or deer.
Attention is called to the three figured zones or belts on the body, the
upper with the arch inclosing an elk; the middle and narrow belt adorned
with figures of birds with a long crest feather. The helix or scroll is
freely introduced in this variety. The one here figured is typical of
quite a large group. The animals are usually black, as are the lines
separating the spaces.</p>

observe a new feature, a rosette or flower, showing a decided
appreciation of the beautiful, either suggested by the flowers of the
Helianthus or by something introduced by Europeans, but most probably
the former. The different forms of this figure found on this ware

<p>The only black water vase obtained at Zuñi; it was doubtless procured
from some other tribe. The black ware obtained from, this tribe is in
nearly all cases used for cooking, or holding liquids or moist foods. As
remarked in another place, the Zuñi black ware is generally small except
in cases where large quantities of food are to be cooked, which occurs
at feast tunes, when very large vessels are employed.</p>

<p>These are of the usual form, of such vessels, except that they are
generally without the lip. It is possible that to a certain extent they
have been patterned after those observed in use among the Europeans or
white races with whom these Indians have come in contact. But we shall
presently find specimens similar in form among the ancient pottery found
in the ruins of the cliff houses. We are inclined to believe that the
form is original and not borrowed. The figures introduced will suffice
to illustrate the form and usual decorations. The specimens obtained are
generally small, varying in capacity from a pint to half a gallon. These
are known in Zuñi by the name <i>Ē´-mūsch-tōn-ne</i>.</p>

<p>Under this general head are included two forms: one, closely
resembling the true cup, as shown in the figures and to which the Zuñis
apply the name <i>sāt-tsān-nā-mū-yā</i>, and those in the form of ollas
or bowls, and without handles. The decorations of the true cup-shaped
vessels, especially on the inner surface, follow somewhat closely the
patterns found on the bowls. Here we see the zigzag marginal line, the
scalloped bands, the interlaced or tessellated bands with star points,
triangles, scrolls, &amp;c.; but the elongate triangle or lance point is
seldom present. As no new figure is introduced it is unnecessary for me
to describe the decorations. A few are of red or brown ware.</p>

<p>These vessels are generally of medium size, though in some instances
the dimensions vary exceedingly. Those used in cooking for feasts are
quite large, sometimes with a capacity of about ten gallons; the
smallest, designed only for family use, are less than four inches in
diameter and not quite three inches high. They are of two general forms,
one similar to the ordinary pots used on cooking stoves, the other
bowl-shaped. Two specimens in the collection are provided with legs; to
these the Zuñians apply the name <i>sä-mū yĕn-sä-qui-pä</i>. See Fig. <a
href = "#fig432">432</a>. As a general rule, the rims of these vessels
are flared, and on some of
<!--png 602-->
<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<a name = "page359"> </a>
them, close to the rim on the outside, are ear-like projections, which
are probably intended as catches by which, with pokers or sticks, they
can be removed from or arranged in position on the fire. They are never
ornamented, and have no coloring other than that which is acquired in
baking. These vessels are used in cooking such foods as contain liquids.
Three names are applied to cooking pots, having reference to size,
viz<ins class = "correction" title = "period missing">.</ins>:
<i>päh-tēh-le</i> is the large cylindrical pot; the smaller pot of the
same form is <i>päh-tēhl-tsān-nā</i>; and <i>wāh-li-äh-kä-tēhl-le</i> is
the common cooking pot. The Olla or bowl-shaped pot, Fig. <a href =
"#fig433">433</a>, is called <i>sä-mū-yēn</i>.</p>

<h5 class = "ital">BASKETS.</h5>

<p>Called by the Zuñians, <i>āh-wēhl-wi-āh-pä-sāhl</i>. These vessels,
which vary in size from four to eight inches in diameter and from two to
five in depth, are in the form of bowls, sometimes with a handle over
the top like a basket handle, sometimes without. The margin is either
scalloped, as in Fig. <a href = "#fig452">452</a>, or terraced so as to
resemble the section of a pyramid or pueblo, being cut in this form with
a horse-hair while soft. They are always of white ware decorated with
black. The margin is uniformly black, and there is often an inner and
outer submarginal narrow band following the undulations or terraces. The
figures most common, and in fact almost exclusively used, are those
resembling tadpoles, but which, as I learned, are intended to represent
a small crustacean or the larva of an insect common in the water-pools
and streams of the Zuñi country; and the somewhat grotesque figures of
the horned toad (<i>Phrynosoma</i>). These figures are placed both on
the outer and inner surfaces, though the figure of the reptile is
generally found on the outer.</p>

<p>These singular vessels are used by the Indians only in their sacred
and ceremonial dances. In them is placed a small quantity of meal; they
are then borne in the hands of the women, who, during the dance, take a
small quantity of the meal, just as much as they can hold between the

tips of the fingers, and sprinkle it on the sacred objects and on the
heads of the persons leading in the ceremonies.</p>

<p>These are always small, but vary in size from one and a half to three
inches in height. They are usually in the form of water vases or
globular jars, though sometimes of a true cup shape, and occasionally
cubical. They are generally single, but quite often double, and
occasionally triple and quadruple. To the large-sized single ones the
Zuñians apply the name of <i>hĕl-i-pō-kā-tēhl-le</i>; and to those of
smaller sizes, <i>hĕl-i-pō-kā-tēhl-tsān-nā</i>. They are usually without
handles, but sometimes these are present. The double ones are connected
only by a bar extending from the body of one to that of the other; and
the triple and quadruple ones in a similar manner. They are of red and
white ware like the other pottery; the decorations on the white are
similar to those already described, so far as they can be adapted to
these small articles.</p>

<p>These figures, which are of small size, the largest not exceeding one
foot in length, are quite rude, rendering it difficult in some cases to
tell what animal is intended, the only exceptions to this rule being
some figures of owls, in which the Zuñians appear to have made the
nearest approach to the true form. They are generally of white ware,
decorated with colors. Often these decorations are arbitrary, but as a
general rule there has been an evident attempt to imitate nature so far
as it could be done with the various shades of brown and black.</p>

<p>Some of the larger pieces, especially the owls, have an opening at
the top or on the back, as though designed for water vessels.</p>

<p>The objects most commonly represented are owls (which largely
predominate), antelope, elk, ducks, and chickens. The human form, the
pig, sheep, horse, &amp;c., are occasionally represented.</p>

color. It is shaped more like a wedge than the cut indicates. It is
difficult to conjecture what this implement could have been used for.
The sandstone of which it is made is too soft for either splitting or
hammering. As it is about ten inches long and has four flat sides it may
have been a grinder, as many of those implements are not unlike it in

<p>These are usually unadorned and of brown or black ware. The number
obtained was not large, and they vary greatly in character. They are
generally of medium size or small, and some which appear to be used as
cooking vessels have a handle on the side and resemble pitchers and
cups. Some have two handles and are shaped like an urn or olla; others
appear to be true pots. The want of uniformity among this tribe in the
use of vessels of this kind renders its difficult to class them
according to use. I will, therefore, group them according to form.
Except one or two of the little pots none of them are ornamented.</p>

<h5 class = "ital">LADLES.</h5>

<p>Of these vessels, which are extensively used by the Shinumos, there
are various forms with an almost endless variation in decoration, being
generally of ornamented white ware. Some of them bear a strong
resemblance to the skillets used on cooking stoves, the handle being
looped, but the bowl is more saucer-shaped. Others, as shown in Figs. <a
href = "#fig527">527</a> and <a href = "#fig529">529</a>, are evidently
fashioned after gourds. Some are somewhat of the form shown in Figs. <a
href = "#fig439">439</a> and <a href = "#fig440">440</a>, but the handle
is more distinct. Others are true cup-shaped vessels, with the handles
projecting from the middle of the side. A few are double with a single
handle.</p>

<p>Skillet-shaped vessels. Usually decorated in the bowl. As these
figures

<p>The clay images or statuettes obtained from the Shinumo pueblos are
not objects of worship as supposed by many persons, but appear to be

civilized races. This is evident from their form and ornamentation which
rudely represent the ordinary clothing worn by these Indians, and in the
female figures the usual mode of wearing the hair either in a bunch at
the back of the head or in two wheel-shaped knots at the sides. In a few

attached to the ears.</p>

I am not aware that these images are used in their dances or religious
ceremonies. If they are objects of worship it must be in the family
only, or a secret worship of which I obtained no information.</p>

<p>Images are introduced, however, in their dances and religious rites,
but these are made of wood and highly ornamented, some of which were

black lines over the shoulder and around the body, terminating so as to
represent hands; small earlets, made of blue beads, suspended from the
ears; face in white, with black spots to represent month and eyes;

about thirty inches high, the smallest not more than five. They are
objects of worship in one form or another. The illustrations in the
woodcuts and colored plates will convey a better idea of them than could
be given in a description. They are entirely composed of wood, with
feathers and other small ornaments attached to them occasionally.</p>

former are eating bowls and are of the general form, or perhaps more
hemispherical than usual. The small ones vary in shape from the
preceding form to that of a flat-bottomed basin. The decorations present
but little similarity to those we have previously described from other
tribes; white ware with colored decorations.</p>

<p>There are but few pieces of this pottery, yet a careful examination
of these since my return increases my desire to procure more. The Acoma
bears a strong resemblance, especially in the ornamentation, to that
from Laguna. All that was obtained was of white ware with decorations in
color. In this pottery, in most cases where animals are figured, they
have a base or ground on which to stand.</p>

<p>This is a light brown micaceous ware, and the pieces are all small,
or comparatively so. They consist of pots, pitchers, and cups.</p>

<p>This small collection, though not obtained directly from the
Jicarilla Apaches, is attributed to them, for the reason that wherever
found among other tribes it is by them accredited to the Apaches. It is
manufactured, however, by some of the Pueblos along the Rio Grande, and
occasionally by the more western Pueblos. The party did not visit the
Apaches mentioned, and are not positively certain that they manufacture
pottery. These facts are mentioned in this connection to show that there
is some question as to the origin of this small collection.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
